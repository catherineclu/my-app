## About this Project

We are building a mobile application for users to order traditional Asian 
food in the United States. While there are Asian restaurants and grocery 
stores throughout the country, not all of them sell and deliver side 
dishes and otherwise simple, homemade meals. There are currently small, 
local one-person vendors on chat services like KakaoTalk that make and 
sell these side dishes. However, for people who do not speak Asian 
languages, these local vendors can be hard to find and contact. In 
addition, these vendors do not usually provide delivery services. Our app 
seeks to provide an easily accessible, centralized digital marketplace for 
both these vendors and customers. We hope to also promote a broader 
appreciation for traditional, homecooked Asian cuisine.
